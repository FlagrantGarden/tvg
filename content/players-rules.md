## Attribute Checks

If you have neither the necessary skill nor proper tools for the task, you cannot succeed.

If you have either the necessary skill or proper tools, roll 1d20. If the result is equal to or less than your most appropriate Attribute, you succeed.

If you have both the necessary skill and the proper tools, you automatically succeed.

## Saving Throws

To make a Save, roll 1d20. If the result is equal to or less than your Saving Throw (ST), you succeed.

## Grit and Flesh

When you take damage, subtract the damage from your Grit.

If you have no Grit remaining, subtract the damage from your Flesh instead.

If you have no Flesh remaining, Save vs death. If you succeed, you pass out---wake with 1 Flesh after 1d6 Rounds. If you fail, you die.

## Rest and Healing

If you have taken no Flesh damage and spend ten minutes resting, heal 1d6 Grit. If you have taken Flesh damage, you cannot heal Grit.

Flesh damage can only be healed by a surgeon. In most settlements, it takes 50gp and a full day of rest for each Flesh damage healed.

## Carrying Things

You have 10 inventory slots. Your weapons, armor, and treasure take up slots when you carry them.

Weapons take up slots equal to the number of hands required to wield them. Armor takes up slots equal to half its maximum AC. Each slot can hold up to 200 coins and gems.

Mundane adventuring gear takes up no slots---just be reasonable about how much you carry, please.

## Gear Bubbles

You have 5 Gear Bubbles.

At any time, you may fill in a Gear Bubble to add any piece of mundane adventuring gear to your inventory, as if it had always been there.

While in a settlement, you may pay 25gp to empty all of your Gear Bubbles.

## Melee Weapons

- _Small_, 2gp. 1d6-1 damage. -1 enemy AC.
- _Medium_, 6gp. 1d6 damage.
- _Large_, 12gp. 1d6+1 damage. Two hands.

If dual-wielding one-handed melee weapons, +1 AV.

## Ranged Weapons

- _Small_, 2gp. 20'. 1d6-1 damage.
- _Medium_, 6gp. 40'. 1d6 damage.
- _Large_, 12gp. 80'. 1d6+1 damage.

Readying or reloading a small ranged weapon takes no action.

Readying or reloading a medium ranged weapon takes a move action.

Readying or reloading a large ranged weapon takes an entire Round (cannot move or otherwise act).

## Armor and Shields

- _Light_, 20gp. 2 AC.
- _Medium_, 40gp. 4 AC.
- _Heavy_, 60gp. 6 AC.
- _Shield_, 10gp. +1 AC.

Unarmored characters have 0 AC.

## Hiring Helpers

- _Craftsman_, 20gp per week to craft, build, repair.
- _Man-at-Arms_, 15gp per week to fight (light armor, medium melee weapon, small ranged weapon).
- _Torchbearer_, 2gp per week to carry, travel.
- _Specialist_, 100gp per week to perform highly-skilled tasks.

Typically, only Torchbearers and Men-at-Arms will go on adventures. You can hire up to 4 helpers at once.

## Combat Rounds

At the start of each Round of combat, the GM rolls 1d6. If the result is even, the players go first. If it's odd, the enemies go first. On your go in a combat Round, you may move a reasonable distance and take one action.

## Free Attacks

If an enemy in melee does anything other than attack (move away, cast a spell, quaff a potion, draw a weapon), you may make a Free Attack. Magic-Users can make one Free Attack each Round. Fighters can make a number of Free Attacks each Round equal to their level. NPC enemies and monsters can make two each Round.

## Melee Attacks

When you attack an enemy in melee, roll 1d20. If your result is less than or equal to your Attack Value (AV) and above their Armor Class (AC), then you hit them. Roll damage. If your result is either higher than your AV or equal to or lower than your enemy's AC, you miss. If you roll your AV exactly, it's a critical hit: apply damage directly to Flesh, bypassing Grit.

## Ranged Attacks

Ranged attacks work the same as melee attacks, but at a range determined by the weapon used. When firing at greater than your weapon's listed range, roll to hit twice and take the worse result. No weapon can be fired at more than twice its listed range. If you roll a 20 to hit with a ranged weapon, you are out of ammunition. Fill a Gear Bubble or spend half the weapon's cost in a settlement to restock. When firing into melee, determine your target randomly.

## Armor Degradation

When an incoming attack roll is equal to or less than your AC (and therefore misses), lower your armor's current AC by 1. While in a settlement, damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith. It takes 5gp and 1 day of work for each point of AC repaired (up to the armor's starting AC). If your armor's AC ever reaches 0, it's permanently broken and cannot be repaired.

## Special Attacks

If you attack with an advantage (flanking, high ground), you have +2 AV and +2 damage. If you attack an enemy unawares, apply damage directly to Flesh, bypassing Grit. If you hit, you may forgo dealing damage to do something tricky instead: push or trip your enemy, grapple or disarm them, or feint to make two attacks with an advantage next round instead of one without.

## Magic in Combat

Casting spells in combat is dangerous. You cannot cast a spell and move in the same Round. If you take damage before your go in a combat Round, you cannot cast a spell that Round. You can do something else, you just can't cast a spell.

## Casting Spells

You can always cast any spell in your spellbook, or from a scroll. You can safely cast a spell as a ritual, taking 1 hour of concentration per spell level. When casting a spell as a ritual, you automatically control it. You can cast a spell quickly (in a combat Round), but you must roll to control it. To successfully control the spell, roll equal to or under ST but over your own AC. If you fail to control a spell while casting from a scroll, the scroll is destroyed. Roll on the Miscast Table. If you fail to control a spell while casting from your spellbook, mark it Corrupted. Take damage equal to the spell's level, and roll on the Miscast Table.

## Miscast Table

| 1d8 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | You cast a different spell on a different target, in addition to your original spell. |
| 2. | You cast a random spell on a different target, instead of your original spell and target. |
| 3. | You cast a random spell on your original target, in addition to your original spell. |
| 4. | You cast a random spell on your original target, instead of your original spell. |
| 5. | Take 1d6 damage. If you don't take Flesh damage, your spell works as normal. If you do take Flesh damage, the spell fizzles. |
| 6. | Your spell affects a random target. |
| 7. | Your spell has the opposite effect. |
| 8. | Your spell is half as effective. |

## Corrupted Spells

When you cast a Corrupted spell as a ritual, take damage equal to the spell's level. When you quickly cast a Corrupted spell (in a combat Round), you automatically fail to control it. If you sleep 8 hours in a relatively safe location, choose one corrupted spell to purify. It's no longer corrupted.

## Acquiring Spells

When a Magic-User gains a level, they roll a random spell to add into their spellbook, or choose one from a scroll they own.

If a Magic-User studies a spell scroll with a mentor (as Specialist Helper) for a number of weeks equal to the scroll's spell level, they may add that spell to their spellbook.

## Getting XP

You gain Experience Points (XP) for overcoming monsters and accumulating treasure.

For each gold piece you bring from the wilds back to civilization, you gain 1 XP. Monsters give an amount of XP equal to 50 x their HD, whether killed or avoided.

All XP earned is split evenly among the party, but not among Helpers.
