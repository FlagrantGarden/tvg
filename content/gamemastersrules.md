Gamemaster's Rules
==================

Time
----

In a dungeon, time is measured in Turns and Rounds.A dungeon Turn is approximately ten minutes of in-game time. Most things characters do in a dungeon (outside of combat) take one Turn: an Attribute check, a short rest to regain Grit, searching an area.Every Turn, roll 1d6. On a 1, the party has a random encounter. Roll on the appropriate encounter table. Use 1d8 instead for especially empty areas, or 1d4 for especially busy areas.In combat, time passes in Rounds instead. A Round is approximately 1 minute of game time (therefore there are ten Rounds in a Turn). In a combat Round, a character can move a reasonable distance and take one action: ready a weapon, attack, make an Attribute check.Outside of the dungeon, time passes in 6-hour Watches. In a Watch in the wilderness, characters can travel one hex, explore a hex, or make camp and get some sleep. In a Watch in a settlement, characters can walk to and interact with an NPC or location, or find a place to get some sleep. Roll for random encounters each Watch (as for Turns), using appropriate tables for the location as necessary.

Light
-----

A candle, torch, or lantern lights a room. When a player lights a torch or a lantern (with a pint of oil), roll its appropriate dice and mark down the result. Lower the number by one each Turn, when they do something especially strenuous, or when they drop the light source. When the number reaches zero, the light source goes out.\
- Candle, 1d6.\
- Torch, 2d6.\
- Lantern, 3d6.

Surprise
--------

When combat begins, determine (according to the fiction, and common sense) if one side surprises the other. If so, the surprised party takes no actions in the first combat Round.If neither side is surprised, they encounter each other simultaneously.If the encounter distance isn't immediately obvious from the fiction, you can determine it randomly. If indoors or underground, the encounter happens at 1d6 x 10 feet. If outdoors, the encounter happens at 1d6 x 10 yards.

Reactions
---------

Unless it's otherwise obvious, roll to determine an enemy's Reaction when they encounter the party for the first time.

| 2d6 | Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 2-4. | Violent |
| 5-6. | Hostile |
| 7. | Neutral |
| 8-9. | Friendly |
| 10-12. | Helpful |

Morale
------

When there's a chance that an enemy or group of enemies might lose their nerve in combat, roll Morale.- In combat with a single enemy, roll Morale at the end of each Round in which the enemy takes damage to their Flesh.\
- In combat with a group of enemies, roll Morale at the end of each Round in which one of them dies.To roll Morale, roll 1d20 equal to or less than the enemy's best ST. If successful, they continue to fight. If they fail, they run at their first opportunity---they might regroup and strike again from a stronger position.If an enemy is especially brave, roll twice and take the better result. If they're especially cowardly, roll twice and take the worse result.
